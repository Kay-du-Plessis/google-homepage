# google-homepage

This was my first project for The Odin Project.
During this project i learnt how to use HTML and CSS to build a basic webpage, and style it to exact specifications. I had trouble aligning the top navbar with the icons, but in the end I figured it out.
I think the page looks quite accurate, and am proud of the result.
